## v1 · v1.1 → ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-08-28**

Ship facts in [`done.md`](done.md). What follows is what v1 deliberately left.

## v2 → ✅ **SHIPPED 2026-08-28**

Ship facts in [`done.md`](done.md). What v2 deliberately left:

- [ ] **V2.7** ↷ **Paging or search in the library picker.** It loads one page
      (60) and stops. A real catalogue will make it obvious which of the two
      it needs; guessing now means building the wrong one.
- [ ] **V2.8** ↷ **Bulk attach from the gallery.** Selection mode can delete;
      "add these six to a product" is the natural other verb, and needs a
      product picker that does not exist yet.
- [ ] **V2.10** ↷ **Record the pre-resize dimensions.** When the stored
      original is a 4096px re-encode, the row keeps only the stored size. The
      upload card says "resized from …" at the time and nothing does
      afterwards. Two nullable columns would let the gallery say it too.
- [ ] **V2.11** ↷ **Server-side derivation from the archive copy.** Now that
      the archive is a known, bounded 4096px file, deriving further sizes
      (thumbnails, a 800px card image) server-side becomes cheap and
      predictable in a way it was not against arbitrary originals.
- [ ] **V2.9** **Replace a file in place.** Today swapping a photo means
      uploading the new one and unlinking the old one on every product using
      it. A library is where "replace" starts being expected.

## N — Later, unrelated to v2

- [ ] **N.0** ↷ **Infinite scroll on `/gallery`.** It pages at 60 with a
      pager, which is consistent with `/products` and linkable. A photo
      library is scanned rather than read, so continuous loading may suit it
      better — but that trades away the bookmarkable URL, so it is a product
      call rather than an obvious upgrade.
- [ ] **N.1** ↷ **Lighthouse pass on `/products` and `/gallery`** (Performance ≥ 90,
      Accessibility ≥ 95 — the quality bar's last unverified line). The list is
      server-rendered with no client data fetching, so the likely findings are
      image sizing on the thumbnail column and contrast on the status badges.
- [ ] **N.2** **Orphan-file sweep.** Deleting from the library removes the
      row and its links but leaves the bytes (deliberate — a best-effort
      delete half-succeeds on a network blip and leaves rows pointing at files
      that are _sometimes_ gone). v2 makes this more visible, not worse: an
      asset uploaded in the gallery and never attached is now a first-class
      state with its own filter, so the sweep has a clear definition of what
      it may collect — a stored file with no `media_assets` row.
- [ ] **N.3** **Deploy path.** Provision Neon + Vercel Blob, set
      `DATABASE_URL` / `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, migrate the remote branch
      (the runner refuses a Postgres target without `--allow-remote`), and
      register the Google OAuth client. The seams are
      built and unit-tested; **neither has been exercised against the real
      services**, so budget for the first-run surprises rather than treating
      this as configuration.
- [ ] **N.4** **CI secret decision.** `ci.yml` runs the integration project
      against scratch SQLite with no secret, which is genuinely useful — but it
      means **the Postgres dialect is never exercised in CI**. Either add
      `DATABASE_TEST_URL` against a Neon `test` branch, or state in the
      workflow that Postgres is covered only by the deploy.

## L — Later (explicitly deferred, not forgotten)

- [ ] **L.1** **Postgres full-text search** behind the same `list()` method.
      `searchText LIKE '%…%'` cannot use a btree index for a leading wildcard;
      at a few thousand rows that is fine, past that it is a scan. `pg_trgm` or
      a `tsvector` column is the upgrade, and it is local to one repository
      method.
- [ ] **L.2** **Server-side video transcode** if bandwidth justifies it. v1
      stores video bytes as uploaded and only derives a poster. An `ffmpeg`
      step needs its own decision about where it runs (a queue, not a request).
- [ ] **L.3** **Variants and inventory** — options, per-variant SKU/price/stock,
      stock movements. Needs its own spec; roughly doubles the schema and every
      form.
- [ ] **L.4** **Category tree UI.** `categories.parentId` ships unused and v1
      renders one flat level. The column is there so this needs no migration.
- [ ] **L.5** **i18n (en + vi).** English-only was a v1 decision. Strings stay
      grouped per feature, so the `messages.ts` retrofit is mechanical — but the
      catalogue's operators are Vietnamese-speaking, so this is a _when_.
- [ ] **L.6** ↷ **Bulk actions** — multi-select on the list for status changes
      and category assignment. Wanted the first time someone archives twenty
      products one at a time.
- [ ] **L.7** ↷ **Audit trail.** v1 is not event-sourced by design, so there is
      no record of who changed a price. A plain `product_revisions` table would
      cover the actual need without reopening that decision.
